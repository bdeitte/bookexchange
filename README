The BookExchange

Other than this README update, these are the original files from 1999.  This was a book changes used on the University of Iowa campus at that time, with design from Dave Selden.  Once in awhile I send out these files to developers I know, as an example of some really old code that I wrote, just for the amusement factor.  Using any of this code for any other purpose may be hazardous to your health.-

From the original README:

Run install.cgi to setup the BookExchange on your site.  It does more than just copy files, so its a good idea to use it instead of trying to move things around yourself.

More information about this product and updated versions can be found at http://cs.uiowa.edu/~bdeitte/bookexchange

If you have trouble installing or running this program, please check the page above to see if the question has already been answered.  If you think you've found a bug, please email me at bdeitte@cs.uiowa.edu.

I'll try to fix any bugs found as quickly as I can, but am not planning to add features this program.  If you'd added anything yourself and like it'd be available to others, please let me know!

This is mostly a repackaging of a book exchange I created for the University of Iowa which can be seen at http://bookexchange.cs.uiowa.edu
