Try to use the "Title" value for searching.  Since this field must be
filled in when someone adds a book, you have a better chance of finding
the book you are looking for.
</font><p>
<FONT FACE="Helvetica">
If your word/phrase search doesn't find what you are looking for, try a
less restrictive search.  You can truncate your search key
(ie Meta instead of Metamorphosis) to look for close matches and
misspellings.</font><p>

You can search by phrase and department at the same time by entering a
value for both searches.  For example, to find all books by Joyce used in
the English department:  select Title, enter Joyce in the field, and
select English from the list of departments.  Then click on either 'search
by word' or 'search by department' to search the books.
