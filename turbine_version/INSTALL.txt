REQUIRED PACKAGES:

The program uses the Turbine framework.  The latest version is available at:
	http://www.working-dogs.com/daily/

These packages must also be in your servlet classpath:
	ECS 1.1 or later: http://java.apache.org/ecs/

	Village 1.1 or later: http://www.working-dogs.com/village/

	JavaMail and Activation: http://java.sun.com/products/javamail/

	JSDK 2.0 or later: http://java.sun.com/products/servlets/download.html

In addition to these packages, a servlet engine is required.  Two popular choices are
	JServ: http://jserve.apache.org
	JRun: http://www.jrun.com
	
COMPILING:

To compile, use the source in src folder.  Otherwise, pre-compiled classes are
available in the bin folder.

INSTALLING:

Edit your TurbineResources.properties file (that you got from the Turbine 
distribution) and change the following properties:

    module.packages=org.apache.turbine
    TO
    module.packages=com.deitte.bookexchange.com,org.apache.turbine

    screen.homepage=Login
    TO
    screen.homepage=MainMenu
    
    If you are using MySQL, then set these values appropriately
    database.default.driver=org.gjt.mm.mysql.Driver
    database.default.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost/bookexchange
    database.default.username=
    database.default.password=

Next install the database and database schema. The first schema is located in 
the Turbine distribution.  
    
    mysqladmin create bookexchange
    mysql bookexchange < MySQL_users_roles_permissions.sql
    mysql bookexchange < bookexchange.schema

Make sure your servlet engine is started, and then then go to this URL:
    
    http://www.server.com/zone/Turbine
    
    Where www.server.com is your server.
    Where zone == your zone that you put Turbine into.
